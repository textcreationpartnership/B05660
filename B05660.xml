            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>Whereas, We have seen a Letter directed to Our Secretaries, from the Lords of Our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Council, Complaining, That the Sea-men of this Our Ancient Kingdom, are Pressed, contrair to the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to the great hurt and prejudice of the Trade thereof; We are resolved to give strict Orders, that no such thing be done for the future; But We do expect in Return to Our Care and Concern, for the welfare of this Our Antient Kingdom, That being Ingaged in a War, which not only concerns Our Kingdoms of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but almost all <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> The Subjects of this Our Antient Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> will heartily Contribute what they can, for Our Assistance, in providing to Our Navy, a thousand Sea-men or more, and for their Incouragement, We will pay to each Sea-man who voluntar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Engages, fourty shillings Sterling, before they shall march from their respective Places, where they shall ingage and take on for our Service to <hi>Leith,</hi> in order to be Shipped Aboard Our Fleet, and full Pay thereafter, as Our <hi>English</hi> Sea-men do receive. And to the effect, the saids Sea-men may be timously taken on, and ingaged for Our Service, and Raised orderly, with als much Ease and Conveniency to Our Subjects as possible; Therefore We, with Advice of the Lords of Our Privy Council, strictly Require and Command, all the Magistrats of the several <hi>Maritim</hi> Burghs Royal, and other Sea-Towns, To cause beat Drums, and make Intimation upon a Mercat-Day, for Levying Sea-Men, to serve in Our Fleet, within their own Jurisdiction, and the next adjacent Sea-Towns, exprest in the several Letters, sent to them for that effect, and to ingage, and take on for the said Service, such as voluntarly offer themselves; And We, with Advice foresaid, Require and Command, the saids Magistrats of <hi>Maritim</hi> Burghs Royal, and other Sea-Towns, to give in a Report to the Council, what number of Sea-men they have so taken on, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, with an exact subscribed List of the whole other Sea-men, and Fisher-men within their Jurisdiction, and other Sea-Towns and Bounds exprest in their respective Missive Letters, upon Oath, betwixt and the days following, <hi>viz.</hi> All on this side of <hi>Tay,</hi> and this side of the <hi>Largs,</hi> upon the Mouth of <hi>Clyde,</hi> betwixt and the twenty Day of <hi>Feruary</hi> next; And all to <hi>Aberdene inclusivè,</hi> and be-west the River of <hi>Clyde,</hi> and the <hi>Largs,</hi> betwixt and the first Day of <hi>March</hi> thereafter; And all the rest of the Kingdom betwixt and the tenth Day of the same Moneth; with power to the saids Magistrats to take the Oaths of Masters of Ships, Boats, Barks, or others, and use all other effectual Means, for making up the saids Lists, that the Lords of Our Privy Council may consider how far the number of Sea-men to be Levied for Our Fleet, falls short, that so they may compleat the said number of a Thousand Sea-men for Our Service by Lot, out of the saids Lists of Sea-men, and have them in readiness before Our Fleet shall go to Sea: And We, with Advice foresaid, Do Certifie and give Assurance to all and every one of the Magistrats and others, who shall take on any of the saids Sea-men, who List themselves voluntarly for Our Service, that how soon, and whensoever the Lists of the said voluntar Sea-men shall be returned to Our Privy Council; fourty shillings sterling Money, shall be immediatly sent to the saids Magistrats, for each Sea-man of these who voluntarly List themselves, to be payed and delivered to them, before they shall march from their own homes to <hi>Leith,</hi> where they are to be Shipped; and sufficient Provisions shall be made, or Pay advanced to them from that time to their being Shipped for Our Fleet; With Certification to such of the saids Magistrats who shall fail or delay in the exact observance hereof, they shall be reputed negligent in their Duty, and disaffected to Our Government, and proceeded against accordingly. And to the effect Our Pleasure in the Premisses may be known, OUR WILL IS and We Charge you straitly and Command, that incontinent these Our Letters seen, ye pass to the Mercat-Cross of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and whole other Mercat-Crosses of the Burghs-Royal, and of Regalities, Stewartries and Bailliaries within this Kingdom, and there in Our Name and Authority, make intimation and publication of the Premisses, that none may pretend ignorance, as ye will answer to Us thereupon.
